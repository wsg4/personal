            <h2>Hello there.</h2>
                <p>I like to keep things simple. Take this site: a custom HTML/CSS build that is lightweight and responsive. It doesn't need any fancy javascript to animate objects or bog down the browser load time. Instead, it's direct and to the point. After all, what good is a fancy-looking website if it cannot communicate effectively to an end-user?</p>

                <p>When web-design was still in its infancy, I began my journey into the world of HTML/CSS. Learning about markup languages in middle-school fascinated me, and I remember building my own website with countless frames, tables, and even background music. Through high-school and college, I continued to take courses here and there to bolster my skills on the web. It was not until 2007 when I got to put my skills to the test - and with that I completely rebuilt my youth-group's website from scratch. I've been working online ever since.</p>

                <p>I enjoy creating and problem solving. But mostly, I enjoy helping people. If you'd like to get in touch, find ways to contact me at the bottom of the page. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
