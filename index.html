            <h2>Hello there.</h2>
                <p>When it comes to front-end web design, I like to keep things simple and straightforward. Take this site: a custom HTML/CSS build that is lightweight and responsive. It's direct and to the point. After all, what good is a fancy website if it cannot communicate effectively to its user?</p>

                <p>In school I was always fascinated with markup languages. I built my first website in the 90's, complete with frames, animated gifs, and even some awful background music. I continued creating websites as a hobby until 2007, when I was able to begin my professional career in web-development and I rebuilt my youth group's website from the ground up. I've been working online ever since.</p>

                <p>I enjoy desigin and development, but mostly, I enjoy helping people.  If you need some help managing your online content for your business, please use the links at the bottom of the page to contact me. I'd love to see if I can help.
