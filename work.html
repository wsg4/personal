            <h2>Professional Work</h2>
            <p>I am currently a digital content manager with over ten years of experience in managing online content and adapting to new social media trends to engage our target audience. I am knowledgable in front-end development, which includes the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. I enjoy designing and developing sites that are lightweight, simple, and responsive.</p>
            
            <p>I have also worked heavily in digital and print content creation, designing anything from flyers, to posters, to program booklets, to stickers, to t-shirts. In addition to designing a new website for my youth group, I worked on designing all of our advertising collaterals and our t-shirts and hoodies. I even developed a YouTube channel focused primarily on using graphics to teach and engage youth in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/catholicwords">Catholic Word of the Day</a>.</p>
            
            <p>My current employ also has me working in client-facing relations and cross-departmental team management. I have additional experience in leadership, organization, communication, public speaking, and event planning.</p>

                <p>During a departmental restructure, the Media Resource Library was absorbed into the Office of Faith Formation. As the Administrative Assistant, I acted as the Media Resource Library administrator, which was a liaison between the Education Vicariate and the IT Department. Together, we worked on web-development projects, including a Diocesan-wide website redesign and the launching of separately designed subdomains for temporary websites. Additionally, I catalogued a library of over 3,000 items, including books, DVDs, and VHS tapes, and updated card-catalogue to Libib, a digital platform database.</p>
