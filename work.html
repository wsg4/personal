            <h2>Professional Work</h2>
            <p>I am a business analyst with over fifteen years of experience working online. I primarily work in front-end development and, in addition to designing sites that are lightweight and responsive, I enjoy creative problem solving in managing online content.</p>
            
            <p>My background includes creating digital content and adapting to new social media trends as they develop. I have designed websites, flyers, posters, program booklets, badges, banners, stickers, and even video content. In addition to designing and deploying my youth group's website, I created all of our advertising collaterals, t-shirts, and hoodies.</p>
            
            <p>More recently in my career, I have taken on a more collaborative role in working with our architecture and dev team to update and enhance our websites and online software. My primary focus is designing updates for value-added enhancements for our users and stakeholders.</p>
                
            <p>I also have experience in Event Planning (for small retreats or large conventions), Team Management (working with 32 different branches of my region), and Technology Services (in doing level 1 help-desk tasks).</p>
